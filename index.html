    <div id="intro">
      <p>When quarantine began, Canadians began flocking to grocery aisles, buying up baking ingredients en masse. Now that a year has passed, and bread flour is back on the shelves, just what recipes were so alluring to draw Canadians to the kitchen?</p>
      <p>As any good researcher should do, when in doubt I turned to Google, or in this case the Google of Google. Every year, Google releases their <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/GLOBAL/" target="_blank">Year In Search</a>, listing out the top 10 search terms per pre-defined category. Luckily for us, they have categories for both recipes and diet. It is my goal, with this project, to show how Canadians have been eating in COVID 2020.</p>
      <p>Eating, does not only mean cooking. To supplement the Google Trends data, I also turned to the top 10 food orders that Uber Eats revealed. After all, if people ordered butter chicken the most on Uber Eats, do they also search for it the most? Spoiler: Nothing beats poutine. In any case, take the dashboards below as a sort of investigation into food popularities in Canada during COVID.</p>
      <p>To round things off, I ended this project with a look at <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/" target="_blank">Google Mobility Data</a>. They chart traffic and movement trends across pre-determined categories, including Retail and Recreation (restaurants included), and Grocery and Pharmacy. They measure daily traffic percent change in relation to a baseline (established as a week in January 2020, before the pandemic). With takeout and cooking being the defacto food options during quarantine, you will see the struggling traffic flow for Retail and Recreation, and the gradual recovery of Grocery and Pharmacy stores.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, this is just a glimpse into what has occupied Canadians’ minds during quarantine when it comes to food options, supplemented by mobility data to see if everything adds up. You will be able to see what recipes gripped the public’s attention, what new trends emerged during COVID, and what eventually fell off.</p>

          <p>The dashboard on the side showcases the 2020 top recipes and diets on a 5 year period. As you play around with the dashboard you will notice the foods that are a COVID-19 created fad (looking at you sourdough discards) and some that the pandemic has no impact at all (Keto diet searches dipped in popularity, guess no one wanted to stay healthy when quarantining). There are also those that spiked to 2020 top 10 due not to COVID, but rather Christmas (2020 was the year the air fryer made its home in many a kitchen).</p>
          <p>The recipes and diets are ordered from most popular to last. Further information can be found <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/US" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Note: Google search trends uses popularity as a metric. Data points with a score of 100 only mean that for the data range, the search at that date was relatively the most popular. As you go through the article you will notice that I have chosen specific anchor points so that the popularity does not fluctuate during comparisons. </p>

        <p>For those wanting to skip the dashboard exploration, here’s a quick rundown:</p>
      </div>

      <div id="tabs">
        <div id="tab1">
          <h3>COVID-19 Trends that persisted:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Buttermilk recipes saw a spike in COVID, and remained at a relatively higher level for the rest of 2020. Whether this means people are trying to make buttermilk at home or find some use for excess buttermilk I’m not sure.</li>
            <li>Sourdough discard recipes are a sight to behold. Basically unheard of before 2019, its searches have reached incredible heights since COVID.</li>
            <li>Bread definitely spiked in COVID (the alternative would be people sitting on bags of unused bread flour), and have persisted at a slightly higher than normal level till the end of 2020.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div id="tab2">
          <h3>Passing Trends:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Easy Cookie Recipes saw a spike in early COVID, but it was only around the level of popularity cookies usually get during Christmas.</li>
            <li>For some reason people flocked to scalloped potatoes at the very beginning….then barely anything moving forward.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div id="tab3">
          <h3>Not a COVID Trend:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Butternut squash was not a COVID food at all. It’s more a Christmas spike in searches.</li>
            <li>Coleslaw just spikes in predefined periods. Nothing special when looking at COVID data. For those interested in coleslaw, do take a look at the data.</li>
            <li>Crockpots dipped. Steady decline from pre-COVID and continued downwards before slightly picking up again in the winter. It seems like its time has passed.</li> 
            <li>Breakfast is popular, has always been popular, will always be popular.</li>
            <li>Air fryer is the new kid on the block. COVID did nothing to its popularity. Christmas, however, now that’s where air fryer racked up the popularity points.</li>
            <li>All diets. Diets just weren’t a thing during COVID, who knew?</li>
          </ol>

        <div>
          <p>I was also curious to see how Canadians’ love for food would match up against more COVID related search terms. Luckily Google’s Year in Search has a “How to” category that listed “How to apply for EI” and “How to get tested for Coronavirus” in their top 10. Instead of diets, I looked up the <a href="https://www.timeout.com/montreal/montreal-news/uber-eats-most-popular-food-canada-051520" target="_blank">Uber Eats top 10 food orders by Canadians</a> and included them into the dashboard.</p>
          <p>Due to the nature of Google popularity being relative to the highest point, the dashboard uses “How to apply for EI” as an anchor. On March 22, 2020, the search for “How to apply for EI” reached an all-time high and has completely dwarfed all other food searches. As such, to keep the popularity from adjusting, all recipes and food searches are synced to EI popularity values. </p>
          <p>Feel free to explore and play around with the dashboard to see how the different food and recipe items compare. When you’re done, try clicking the “What about deliveries?” button to see a comparison between “How to apply for EI” and searches for food delivery services.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="content4">
      <p>While “How to apply” for EI reached peaks no other food or recipe could, searches for EI soon rapidly dropped. Likewise, searches for “How to get tested for Coronavirus” is barely a factor in the wide Google-verse. Noticeable standouts in the list include the ever-present Canada’s darling food – poutine; the stable popular choices of bread making and naan ordering; and of course, air fryer recipes seeing the beginning of a sharp rise at the end of the year. It seems like Canadians default to well Canadian food, Indian food, and Japanese food as their go tos.</p>
      <p>But none of the recipe and food items even compared to searches for food delivery services. At the peak of EI, March 22, 2020, its search popularity momentarily eclipsed Uber Eats and Door Dash, but trailed significantly behind terms containing Uber or Skip the Dishes. Even for Uber Eats and Door Dash, they soon dwarfed EI searches after a week. It also looks like Uber and Skip the Dishes are more popular than Door Dash in Canada, not that it comes at too much of a surprise. </p>

        <p>You would therefore be right to assume that when you look at Google Mobility data, Retail and Recreation would be harder hit than Grocery and Pharmacy. The dashboard to the side tracks a Canada wide shift week by week in Retail and Recreation, and Grocery and Pharmacy percentage changes from the baseline. For more detailed information please visit https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/answer/9825414. In short however, please do not compare Retail and Recreation with Grocery and Pharmacy. They are compared with a baseline week taken in January 2020 before the pandemic and are not on the same scale.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The maps are a week-by-week comparison by region, taking the average baseline as the value.</li>
          <li>The line graph is best viewed by looking at all weeks and choosing specific weekdays. That way you will be able to track Monday comparisons throughout 2020 and have the most true to data evaluation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nonetheless, have fun looking at how the regions are experiencing mobility on a week-by-week basis. You will eventually see that while Retail and Recreation still show negative percentage changes compared to the baseline, Grocery and Pharmacies are actually seeing some positive percentage mobility increases compared to the baseline.</p>

            <p>Canada loves poutine, has loved poutine, and will continue to love poutine. That and our country has apparently discovered an urge to make use of sourdough discards along with a strange love of buttermilk recipes.</p>
            <p>Yet all these recipes and foods pale in comparison to takeout. The increase in takeout and the potential increase in cooking (it’s really hard to tell whether Canadians are cooking more or they just decided to make scalloped potatoes for a week and collectively gave up) has really reduced mobility towards retail and recreation.</p>
            <p>Ultimately this is story on Canadians’ lifestyle and fads relating to food during COVID-19 in 2020. Maybe you will find some of these search terms resonating with your experiences, maybe not. With what we’re seeing in the data, all I can say is with how much we love food delivery services, support local restaurants, and see if you can circumvent delivery apps occasionally.</p>
